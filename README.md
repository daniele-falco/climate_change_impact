# climate_change_impact
This work is about the implemetation of a statistical downscaler. It is a tool, used in the context of IAMs (integreted assessment models) to link the global temperature, i.e. the only variable present in the IAM, to the local temperature, i.e. the variable used to compute climate change impact on countries.)
